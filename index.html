        <h2>So just who does this man think he is?</h2>

        <p><strong>Hello there,</strong></p>
         <p>I am Waaday Forrester III also know in the common man's tongue as Wade L Byker.  Currently, I reside in Nashville, Tennesse, it is an awesome busy city that celebrates rapid growth and country music. It's music is much like the rest of the state in that it is from another time and seperated from most current cultural norms. Oh, and Taylor Swift lives here to!!
        
        <p>During the earlier years of my life I was in the Marines for 4 years, and the Army for 3 years. While enlisted I attained the rank of E-5 Sergeant, and did a year tour Baghdad, Iraq throughout 2006-2007. I have gone to college for Graphic Design, and basic Electrical Engineering classes. My son is 15 and I tutor him in life skills and computer science. He has goals of going to the Air Force Academy, and getting a degree in Cyber Secruity.</p> 
           
        </p>Since then I have been pursing a career in Web Developer/Software Enginneering. I have been playing with technology in one form or another since way back when AOL came out in 96, so it seems like a logical fit. It is my hope to bring my enthusiasm about building great web sites and contents.</p>
